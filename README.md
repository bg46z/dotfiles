dotfiles
========

This is a collection of my dotfiles. This also contains a scripts directory to run scripts and other things from. 
below is a list of the programs that need the dotfiles. 

* `i3-wm`
* `i3status`
* `zsh`
* [`vim`](http://github.com/bg46z/vim)

This uses submodules for some things. 

so after you clone, you have to do the following:

`$ git submodule init && git submodule update`
